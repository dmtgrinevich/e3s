If something went wrong during the creation/execution/finish phase, the client will receive an error message from E3S or Selenium. This paragraph will describe all possible errors from the E3S side.

### Selenium type errors:

* name: `session not created`, status: `500`.
    * `failed to start executor` - failed to build an execution environment (browser/version/device is not supported).
    * `service startup timed out` - failed to start service under 9 mins (by default).
    * `error forwarding the new session request timed out waiting for a node to become available` - all nodes are busy, and task didn't start in time (no free resources for task were found).
    * `failed to create task` - failed to find an existing task definition or to place a new task into pending task's pool.
    * `failed to start task` - failed to start healthy (executable) task due to wrong parameters/internal error.
    * `failed to set network configuration` - failed to find host port for newly created task due to any fatal internal error.
    * `failed to start driver` - usually the main reason is a wrong selenium's driver capabilities/driver capabilities format.
